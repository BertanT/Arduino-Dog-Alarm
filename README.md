# Arduino Dog Alarm
 This simple code activates a relay and a buzzer when an object -   potentially a dog - gets closer to a Sharp IR distance   sensor than a user-defined threshold distance.  Made for the school STEM exhibition event!
 
 ##### The [SharpIR Arduino Library](https://github.com/qub1750ul/Arduino_SharpIR) is required to function. Please install it using the library manager if you want to use this code!

Not tested yet!
